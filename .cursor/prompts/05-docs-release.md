# Agent Prompt 05 — Documentation & Release Preparation

You are preparing comprehensive documentation and release infrastructure for the HEE/HEER standards ecosystem.

## Objectives
1) Create complete API and implementation documentation
2) Establish release automation and packaging infrastructure
3) Set up version management and changelog generation
4) Prepare CI/CD pipeline for automated quality assurance

## Constraints
- Follow PROMPTING_RULES.md exactly - security validation mandatory
- Documentation must enable independent HEE/HEER implementation
- Release process must support ecosystem certification
- CI/CD must enforce security and compliance requirements

## Steps

### 1. API Documentation (docs/API.md)
**Objective**: Document complete HEE/HEER API specifications

**Requirements**:
- Core abstractions with type definitions
- Command and query interface specifications
- Event schema documentation
- Integration contract definitions

**Validation**:
- APIs enable deterministic interoperability
- Documentation includes security considerations
- Examples are executable and correct
- Version compatibility clearly specified

### 2. Implementation Guide (docs/IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE.md)
**Objective**: Provide comprehensive implementation guidance

**Requirements**:
- Step-by-step implementation roadmap
- Architecture decision rationales
- Common pitfalls and solutions
- Performance optimization guidance

**Validation**:
- Guide enables independent implementation
- Examples work with current codebase
- Security considerations integrated
- Performance guidance validated

### 3. Contributing Guidelines (docs/CONTRIBUTING.md)
**Objective**: Establish contribution standards for ecosystem

**Requirements**:
- Development workflow documentation
- Code quality and testing standards
- Security contribution requirements
- PR review and merge criteria

**Validation**:
- Guidelines align with PROMPTING_RULES.md
- Security requirements clearly specified
- Process enables ecosystem participation
- Standards are enforceable

### 4. Changelog Infrastructure (docs/CHANGELOG.md + scripts/changelog.py)
**Objective**: Implement automated changelog generation

**Requirements**:
- git-cliff integration for automated changelogs
- Conventional commit parsing
- Release note generation
- Ecosystem impact assessment

**Validation**:
- Changelog automatically generated from commits
- Breaking changes clearly highlighted
- Security fixes prominently featured
- Ecosystem coordination supported

### 5. Version Management (docs/VERSIONING.md + pyproject.toml)
**Objective**: Establish semantic versioning for HEE/HEER components

**Requirements**:
- Semantic versioning specification (semver)
- Breaking change policies for specifications
- Ecosystem compatibility guarantees
- Deprecation and migration policies

**Validation**:
- Version changes follow semver correctly
- Breaking changes require ecosystem coordination
- Migration paths clearly documented
- Compatibility guarantees maintained

### 6. Release Packaging (pyproject.toml + scripts/release.py)
**Objective**: Create automated release and packaging infrastructure

**Requirements**:
- PyPI package configuration
- Automated release script
- Distribution package generation
- Installation verification

**Validation**:
- Package installs correctly across platforms
- Dependencies properly specified
- Release automation is reliable
- Installation includes all required components

### 7. CI/CD Pipeline (.github/workflows/ci.yml)
**Objective**: Implement comprehensive automated quality assurance

**Requirements**:
- Security scanning integration
- Compliance validation in CI
- Automated testing across platforms
- Release automation triggers

**Validation**:
- CI catches security violations
- Compliance checks prevent merges
- Cross-platform compatibility verified
- Release process fully automated
