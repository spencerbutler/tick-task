# Agent Prompt 03 — Security & Validation Framework

You are implementing the comprehensive security and validation framework for the HEE/HEER ecosystem.

## Objectives
1) Build security validation infrastructure for all HEE/HEER implementations
2) Create automated compliance scanning and validation tools
3) Establish HEE/HEER-specific security constraints and monitoring
4) Provide security test vectors and validation procedures

## Constraints
- Follow PROMPTING_RULES.md exactly - security is highest priority
- All validation must be deterministic and repeatable
- Security scanning must prevent known vulnerability patterns
- HEE/HEER security requirements must be enforceable

## Steps

### 1. Security Validation Core (src/security/validator.py)
**Objective**: Implement comprehensive input validation for HEE/HEER systems

**Requirements**:
- Unicode validation and normalization
- Control character blocking and detection
- Zero-width character removal
- Input sanitization with HEE/HEER context awareness

**Validation**:
- All validation functions are deterministic
- Security test vectors pass validation
- Performance overhead is acceptable
- False positives minimized

### 2. Content Sanitization (src/security/sanitizer.py)
**Objective**: Provide content sanitization for human work orchestration

**Requirements**:
- Task description sanitization
- Operator input cleaning
- Event data sanitization
- Policy content validation

**Validation**:
- Sanitization preserves semantic meaning
- Security threats neutralized
- HEE/HEER workflows remain functional
- Audit trail maintained

### 3. Security Audit Framework (src/security/audit.py)
**Objective**: Implement security monitoring and audit capabilities

**Requirements**:
- Security event logging and monitoring
- Compliance violation detection
- Audit trail generation for security events
- Integration with runtime event journaling

**Validation**:
- Security events are tamper-evident
- Audit trails support forensic analysis
- Performance monitoring doesn't impact runtime
- Compliance violations trigger appropriate alerts

### 4. Automated Security Scanner (scripts/security_scanner.py)
**Objective**: Create CLI tool for automated security scanning

**Requirements**:
- File system security scanning
- HEE/HEER-specific security checks
- Vulnerability pattern detection
- Compliance reporting and recommendations

**Validation**:
- Scanner runs without runtime dependencies
- False positive rate below 5%
- Performance suitable for CI/CD integration
- Reports provide actionable remediation steps

### 5. Security Validation CLI (scripts/security_validator.py)
**Objective**: Build CLI tool for HEE/HEER security validation

**Requirements**:
- Runtime security policy validation
- Input validation testing
- Security compliance certification
- Integration with automated testing

**Validation**:
- CLI integrates with existing security workflows
- Validation results are machine-readable
- Performance supports continuous validation
- Security requirements are comprehensively checked

### 6. Security Documentation (docs/SECURITY.md)
**Objective**: Document security requirements and implementation

**Requirements**:
- Threat model for HEE/HEER systems
- Security requirements and constraints
- Implementation guidance for secure HEE/HEER systems
- Security testing and validation procedures

**Validation**:
- Documentation covers all security requirements
- Implementation examples are secure by default
- Testing procedures are comprehensive
- Security considerations integrated throughout

### 7. Security Test Suite (tests/security/)
**Objective**: Create comprehensive security test coverage

**Requirements**:
- Input validation test vectors
- Sanitization effectiveness tests
- Security scanner validation tests
- Integration security tests

**Validation**:
- All security requirements have test coverage
- Tests include known attack vectors
- Security regressions prevented
- Test performance supports CI/CD
