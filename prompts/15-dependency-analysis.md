# Agent Prompt 15 — Dependency Analysis

## Objective
Analyze and justify all third-party dependencies for the FIN-tasks application.

## Core Dependencies Assessment

### Backend Dependencies
**FastAPI** - Web framework
- Value: Async API framework with automatic OpenAPI docs, type validation
- Alternative considered: Flask (more minimal but less structured), Django (too heavy)
- Justification: Essential for API functionality, widely adopted, minimal overhead
- Risk: Low (mature, active maintenance)

**SQLAlchemy** - ORM
- Value: SQL abstraction, migration support, relationship handling
- Alternative considered: Peewee (lighter but less featured), raw SQL (error-prone)
- Justification: Required for complex queries, relationships, and data integrity
- Risk: Low (industry standard, comprehensive)

**Alembic** - Database migrations
- Value: Version-controlled schema changes, rollback capability
- Alternative considered: Manual SQL scripts (error-prone, hard to track)
- Justification: Essential for production data safety and updates
- Risk: Low (SQLAlchemy companion, well-maintained)

**Pydantic** - Data validation
- Value: Type-safe data models, automatic validation, JSON schema generation
- Alternative considered: dataclasses + manual validation (boilerplate heavy)
- Justification: Critical for API contract validation and type safety
- Risk: Low (FastAPI dependency, excellent maintainer)

### Frontend Dependencies
**React** - UI framework
- Value: Component-based architecture, virtual DOM, rich ecosystem
- Alternative considered: Vue.js (similar), Svelte (smaller bundle)
- Justification: TypeScript support, accessibility features, development experience
- Risk: Medium (larger bundle, but acceptable for local app)

**TypeScript** - Type safety
- Value: Compile-time error catching, better IDE support, self-documenting code
- Alternative considered: JavaScript (weaker type safety)
- Justification: Essential for maintainable frontend code at scale
- Risk: Low (industry standard, excellent tooling)

**Tailwind CSS** - Styling
- Value: Utility-first CSS, responsive design, small production bundle
- Alternative considered: CSS modules, styled-components (more complex)
- Justification: Rapid UI development, consistent design system
- Risk: Low (popular, stable)

**React Query** - Data fetching
- Value: Server state management, caching, background updates
- Alternative considered: SWR (similar), Redux (overkill for this use case)
- Justification: Simplifies API integration, handles loading/error states
- Risk: Low (well-maintained, focused scope)

### Development Dependencies
**pytest** - Testing framework
- Value: Comprehensive testing with fixtures, parametrization, plugins
- Alternative considered: unittest (built-in but less featured)
- Justification: Required for maintainable test suite
- Risk: Low (Python standard for testing)

**Playwright** - E2E testing
- Value: Cross-browser testing, reliable automation, fast execution
- Alternative considered: Selenium (older, more complex)
- Justification: Essential for UI testing across different scenarios
- Risk: Low (Microsoft-backed, excellent)

**Pre-commit** - Code quality
- Value: Automated code formatting, linting, and checks
- Alternative considered: Manual checks (inconsistent)
- Justification: Enforces code quality and consistency
- Risk: Low (widely adopted)

### Authentication Dependencies (Conditional)
**Authlib** - OAuth client (if Google OAuth feasible)
- Value: Comprehensive OAuth support, secure token handling
- Alternative considered: Custom implementation (security risks)
- Justification: Required for Google OAuth if implemented
- Risk: Medium (additional complexity, may not be needed if admin-only)

## Dependency Principles
- **Minimal surface area**: Only dependencies with clear, documented value
- **Active maintenance**: All dependencies must have recent releases and active communities
- **Security**: Dependencies must have good security track record
- **Local-first compatibility**: No dependencies requiring internet connectivity

## Bundle Size Analysis
- Backend: ~50MB with all dependencies (acceptable for local app)
- Frontend: <2MB production bundle (excellent for web performance)
- Development: Additional tools only needed during development

## Output
- Create docs/DEPENDENCIES.md with complete analysis
- Update docs/DECISIONS.md with dependency trade-offs
- Ensure all dependencies align with local-first, minimal principles
- Document any conditional dependencies (OAuth) with clear fallback strategies
