# Agent Prompt 01 — Spec editor

## Objective
Refine docs/SPEC.md into an implementation-ready specification with:
- explicit acceptance criteria for v0
- explicit non-goals
- explicit performance/security constraints
- prioritized requirements (Must/Should/Could)

## Output
- Update docs/SPEC.md
- Add any necessary entries to docs/DECISIONS.md (open questions)

## Constraints
- No code.
- Keep dependencies/tooling unspecified unless required; focus on requirements and contracts.
