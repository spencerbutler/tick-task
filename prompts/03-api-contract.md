# Agent Prompt 03 — API contract

## Objective
Refine docs/API.md to a stable, testable contract:
- endpoint list
- request/response shapes
- error envelope
- versioning policy
- polling/eventing approach for v0

## Output
- Update docs/API.md
- Add acceptance criteria to docs/SPEC.md as needed

## Constraints
- No code.
- Keep it minimal but explicit.
