```yaml
hee_specific:
  - state_version: <current HEE state version>
  - decision_stability: <HEE decision preservation metrics>
  - spec_coverage: <HEE spec coverage integration>
  - prompt_compatibility: <HEE prompt version compatibility>
```

### Validation Checklist

## Usage Patterns

### 1. HEE Agent Handoffs

**Pattern**: State capsule chain for agent transitions
```
HEE Agent A → State Capsule → HEE Agent B → Updated State Capsule → HEE Agent C
```

**Benefits**:
- Preserves HEE context across agent transitions
- Maintains HEE decision continuity
- Enables HEE specialization and workflow optimization

### 2. HEE Release Management

**Pattern**: Release-specific state capsules
```
Pre-Release Capsule → Release Capsule → Post-Release Capsule → Maintenance Capsule
```

**Benefits**:
- Clear HEE release phase boundaries
- Comprehensive HEE release documentation
- Decision history for HEE release analysis
- Risk tracking throughout HEE release lifecycle

### 3. HEE Cross-Project Integration

**Pattern**: Ecosystem state capsules
```
HEE Core Capsule → MT-logo-render Integration Capsule → tick-task Integration Capsule
```

**Benefits**:
- HEE ecosystem context preservation
- Dependency management across HEE projects
- Integration point documentation
- HEE-wide decision tracking

## Best Practices

### ✅ HEE Recommended Practices

**Practice 1**: HEE-Specific Context
```yaml
context:
  - HEE Integration: Full state capsule support required
  - HEE Constraints: Must comply with spec-first discipline
  - HEE Dependencies: Core v1.1.5+, prompts v17+
```

**Practice 2**: HEE Decision Rationale
```yaml
decisions:
  - Use HEE canonical prompts for all agent interactions
    Rationale: Ensures HEE editor-agnostic consistency
    Impact: Maintains HEE governance compliance
```

### ❌ HEE Anti-Patterns to Avoid

**Anti-Pattern 1**: Generic HEE Context
```yaml
context:
  - Project: Some HEE project  # Too generic for HEE
```

**Anti-Pattern 2**: Missing HEE Integration
```yaml
next_chat_bootstrap:
  - Continue HEE work  # Too vague for HEE execution
```

**Anti-Pattern 3**: Ignoring HEE State Requirements
```yaml
decisions:
  - Change state format without HEE compatibility  # Violates HEE principles
```

```

### 2. HEE Directory Management

**HEE Automation Scripts**:
```bash
# Create HEE date directory if needed
mkdir -p docs/STATE_CAPSULES/$(date +%Y-%m-%d)

# Find latest HEE capsule
LATEST_HEE=$(ls -dt docs/STATE_CAPSULES/*/ | head -1)/HEE-*.md
```
