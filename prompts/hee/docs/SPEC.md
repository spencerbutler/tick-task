# HEE/HEER Standards Specification (v1.0 - Standards Foundation)

## Product Statement
human-execution-engine provides canonical specifications and reference implementations for Human Execution Engine (HEE) and Runtime (HEER) standards, enabling deterministic human work orchestration across ecosystems.

## Vision
A comprehensive standards framework that defines how systems can treat humans as constrained, deterministic processing units, with humans as the primary runtime rather than passive assignees.

## Success Criteria (v1.0)
- [ ] Complete HEE/HEER conceptual specifications documented
- [ ] Reference runtime implementation demonstrates standards compliance
- [ ] Automated compliance validation tools operational
- [ ] Ecosystem adoption metrics established
- [ ] Standards documentation enables independent implementation
- [ ] Security validation integrated throughout standards
