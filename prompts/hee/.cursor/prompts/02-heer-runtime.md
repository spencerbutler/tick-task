# Cursor Prompt Wrapper - HEER Runtime Implementation

This is a wrapper for the canonical prompt located at:
`prompts/02-heer-runtime.md`

For authoritative development guidance, always reference the canonical prompt file.

## Quick Reference

**Objective**: Build complete HEER runtime with deterministic execution guarantees

**Key Deliverables**:
- src/heer/ - Complete HEER runtime implementation
- src/hee/validation.py - HEE compliance validation
- tests/ - Comprehensive test suites

**Constraints**:
- Runtime must be deterministic under replay
- All HEER contract requirements implemented
- Security validation mandatory

See `prompts/02-heer-runtime.md` for complete implementation guidance.
