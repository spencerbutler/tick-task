# Cursor Prompt Wrapper - Documentation & Release Preparation

This is a wrapper for the canonical prompt located at:
`prompts/05-docs-release.md`

For authoritative development guidance, always reference the canonical prompt file.

## Quick Reference

**Objective**: Prepare comprehensive documentation and release infrastructure

**Key Deliverables**:
- docs/CONTRIBUTING.md - Contribution guidelines
- pyproject.toml - Package configuration
- .github/workflows/ci.yml - CI/CD pipeline
- scripts/release.py - Release automation

**Constraints**:
- Documentation must enable independent implementation
- Release process must support ecosystem certification
- CI/CD must enforce security and compliance

See `prompts/05-docs-release.md` for complete implementation guidance.
