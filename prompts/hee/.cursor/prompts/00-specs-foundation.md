# Cursor Prompt Wrapper - HEE/HEER Specifications Foundation

This is a wrapper for the canonical prompt located at:
`prompts/00-specs-foundation.md`

For authoritative development guidance, always reference the canonical prompt file.

## Quick Reference

**Objective**: Create canonical HEE and HEER specifications as normative documents

**Key Deliverables**:
- docs/HEE.md - Conceptual model specification
- docs/HEER.md - Runtime contract specification

**Constraints**:
- Specifications must be normative (if/and/only if conditions)
- No implementation code - specifications only
- Follow PROMPTING_RULES.md exactly

See `prompts/00-specs-foundation.md` for complete implementation guidance.
