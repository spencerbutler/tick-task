# Cursor Prompt Wrapper - Architecture & API Design

This is a wrapper for the canonical prompt located at:
`prompts/01-architecture-api.md`

For authoritative development guidance, always reference the canonical prompt file.

## Quick Reference

**Objective**: Define reference architecture and establish standard API contracts

**Key Deliverables**:
- docs/ARCHITECTURE.md - Reference architecture guide
- docs/API.md - Standard HEE/HEER API specifications
- docs/COMPLIANCE.md - Certification criteria
- docs/IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE.md - Implementation guidance

**Constraints**:
- APIs must support tick-task and MT-logo-render integration
- Architecture must enable deterministic interoperability
- Security validation mandatory

See `prompts/01-architecture-api.md` for complete implementation guidance.
